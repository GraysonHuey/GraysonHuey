# Hello, my name is Grayson Huey
I am currently a high school junior who loves everything computer science. <br>At the moment, I am enrolled in my school's AP Computer Science A course and will continue on with computer science through the rest of high school.
<br><br>
My first programming language was Python, and it was completely self-taught. I am currently teaching myself how to code in C and a little bit of Asssembly (x86_64 FASM), and it is going incredibly well.
<br><br>
How to reach me: [Email](mailto:graysonhuey02@gmail.com)
<br>
Pronouns: He/Him
<br><br>
Currently working on: Pong in Assembly (FASM x86_64)
